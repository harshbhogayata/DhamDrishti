## What is this?

DhamDrishti is a web-based directory of 24 temples in and around Vadodara. Each entry includes history, architectural notes, timings, entry fees, aarti schedules, and coordinates for navigation.

The focus is on Vadodara specifically — from Gaekwad royal heritage sites like Kirti Mandir and Khandoba Temple, to modern engineering marvels like the EME Dakshinamurthy Temple, to lesser-known vernacular shrines in the old city.
